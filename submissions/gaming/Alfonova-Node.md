## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: GameFi Quest
- *Category**: Gaming

### Description
GameFi Quest is a blockchain-based gaming vApp that combines the concepts of RPG adventure with play-to-earn (P2E).
Problem solved: Many P2E games fail to retain players due to unsustainable economic models. GameFi Quest introduces the Soundness Layer (SL) to ensure a healthier and fairer game economy.
What it does: Players can complete quests, battle bosses, and trade digital items (NFTs). All transactions are regulated by the SL to ensure transparency, security, and no uncontrolled token inflation.
Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

### SL Integration
Using Soundness Layer (SL) for:
Player identity verification → reducing multi-accounts & bot farming.
Transparent in-game economy → SL maintains token supply and demand in accordance with smart contracts.
Fair matchmaking → player data is stored and verified in SL to prevent score manipulation.

##  Technical
### Architecture 
- Frontend (React) → Web-based game user interface + mobile-friendly.
- Backend (Node.js + Rust) → Server logic for gameplay & NFT minting.
- Blockchain (SL + Polygon) → Token & NFT transactions.
- Storage (IPFS + WALRUS) → Game items & assets (armor, swords, skins).

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (API), Rust (game engine logic)
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (identity & economy), Polygon (NFT & marketplace)
- **Storage**: WALRUS (quest data & logs), IPFS (game assets)
- **ZK Framework**: Circom for proof circuits

### Features
1.Play-to-Earn Quest → players can earn tokens by completing missions.
2.NFT Marketplace → trade weapons, armor, and collectibles.
3.SL-Powered Economy → token supply is kept stable via the Soundness Layer oracle.

# Timeline

### PoC (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic quest + wallet integration
- [ ] SL integration (identity & simple token transfer)
- [ ] Simple user interface

### MVP (4–8 weeks)
- [ ] Complete quest system + NFT marketplace
- [ ] In-game economy (P2E model + staking)
- [ ] User testing with Discord community

## Innovation
- [ ] Unique Selling Point (USP):
1.Not just “grind-to-earn,” but interactive story-based quests.
2.Soundness Layer-based economy, not just inflationary tokens.
3.Anti-bot & anti-cheat features based on SL identity → ensuring fairness.
- [ ] Why people will use it:
Because gamers want entertainment + real rewards without the risk of the game's economy collapsing like old P2E games.
